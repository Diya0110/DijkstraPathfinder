Dijkstra's Algorithm: A Simple Pathfinding Project

Imagine you're lost in a maze. You need to find the shortest way out. That's where Dijkstra's algorithm comes in! This project helps you visualize this process on a computer screen.

How it works:

Grid Creation: We create a grid, like a maze, with some cells blocked (like walls).
Starting Point and End Point: You pick a starting point (where you are) and an ending point (the exit).
Dijkstra's Magic: The algorithm starts at your starting point and explores neighboring cells. It calculates the shortest distance to each cell, considering any obstacles.
Path Finding: Once the algorithm reaches the end point, it traces back the shortest path, highlighting it on the grid.
What you can learn:

Algorithm Implementation: Understand how to implement Dijkstra's algorithm in code.
Data Structures: Learn how to use data structures like priority queues and maps to efficiently solve the problem.
GUI Development: Gain experience in creating user interfaces to visualize the pathfinding process.
Problem-Solving: Practice breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable steps.
Why it's cool:

Visual Understanding: See how the algorithm works step by step.
Practical Application: Learn a technique used in many real-world applications, like GPS navigation and network routing.
Fun and Engaging: Experiment with different grid layouts and observe how the algorithm adapts.
By building this project, you'll not only learn about algorithms but also have fun exploring the world of computer science!
